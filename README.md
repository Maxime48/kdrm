KDRM is a backdoor P.O.C panel for Garry's Mod it should never be used on a actual production system and still contains important bugs that makes some features unusable.
This is purelly made to continue Kermini (the predessessor) and represents what a modern backdoor panel would have been capable of.

The name was initially purelly made to confuse people with the real panel's purpose and the "K" just stands for kermini.
